# 安装

## Official Installation

Select `"ADD Python to PATH"` on setup.

## Anaconda Installation（Recommended）

We use Anaconda for one-stop solution of virtual environment and package management.

It will replace your system's default Python installation by taking a earlier position in `PATH`. It's a good thing that you do not have to worry about existing versions.
